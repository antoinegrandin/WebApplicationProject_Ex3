# WebApplicationProject_Ex3

To have access to the app you need to specify the page url : http://localhost:8081/page.html. It does not work if you try only this http://localhost:8081.
Same issue with Heroku, you should enter https://web-app-final-project-ex3.herokuapp.com/page.html 

Duplicate answer is forbidden on directors and actors, I think everything works. 

The starting movie is the great "The Godfather" by Master Coppola. I really enjoyed working on this exercice !
